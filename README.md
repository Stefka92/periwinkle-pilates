Periwinkle Pilates is a website created to promote a three day wellness retreat situated on the beach in Spanish Point, Co.Clare. The idea for the website arose from a local retreat in this area. The website will  outline the benefits of Pilates and taking time to switch off from everyday life in general and what better way to do so other than a Mini seascape.Looking after our health is vital in this day and age and practicing meditation and mindfulness is very important for our overall mental health.
> It has also been proven that Spending time by the sea has been shown to help us feel happier, healthier, calmer and more creative.

This website will be targeted towards any one feeling the added stress of life in general and are looking for a mini escape to recharge their batteries. This website was created for educational purposes only.

## Strategy

### Considering the core UX principles.

I first had to think about who my target audience would be and what would keep it simple and straightforward for them. As mindfulness is about decluttering the mind I decided to keep the website minimal,  clutter free and straight to the point.

Periwinkle Pilates target users are:
- Aged 18 onwards
- Both Male and females
- People interested in health and wellness
- Open minded people willing to try new experiences
- People looking to slow down from everyday life and learn how to switch off both the body and mind.
- Anyone feeling tired or run down and in need of a detox.

What these users would be looking for:
- Easy to navigate website with clear straightforward information.
- Photos that reflect calmness and provide inspiration to Sign up.
- How much the Retreat costs.
- A clear list of what the three day retreat consists of.
Due to the different ranges in ages of the users, it is assumed that there will be  users viewing the site on their Laptops, tablets and mobile phones and therefore creating something responsive is an extremely important aspect in the design.

## Scope

In order to meet the above criteria, the following features will be included in the website
- A Header when clicked will take you back to the home page
- A clear Navigation menu 
- Contact Section
- Social Media links
- A number of images of the beach to bring a sense of calmness to the website

## Structure
The website is made up of four pages, three of which can be accessed from the navigation menu (Home, About & Sign-up). The fourth page is a brief thank you page which you are redirected to once you sign up for the retreat.

All Pages on the website have:

      - A sand background image was added to this page to fit in with the theme of the website.

            The user submits the form using the submit button which is titled **Sign up now**.

   - A brief thanks message to the user letting them know their form has successfully been submitted.

## Skeleton
 
Please note the actual website has changed Since these wireframes.
During the building process I decided to Change the home page and added an image as the background as I felt it stood out more as I had not much content on the home page as I did not want it cluttered. I also added a button to link to the about page if the user wanted to find out more.
I also decided to change my about page slightly and added my image opposite the text as I felt it looked better this way.

## Surface
The website uses a variety of colours that are associated with the beach. The heading is a periwinkle shade which is carried throughout the website to represent the Website name. The brown and wheat colors are to represent the sand. The grey colours are to bring out the colors of the rocks on the beach. The blue colours are to represent the water and give that blue water calming effect. The colour palette was created using the https://coolors.co/ website.



I used Google fonts “Maher” throughout the website as after trialing several different fonts I found this one stood out the most as it was clear and still ledable on smaller devices.
